# Discovery Index

<!-- div:left-panel -->

The Discovery Index (developed in collaboration with the [OSU TEHR](https://ehsc.oregonstate.edu/)) is a set of services 
designed to accept user-submitted form data (especially Google Forms and Qualtrics via a REST API) and convert answers to relationships
stored in a graph database made available for visualization and querying. 

DI is designed to store data primarily about *people*, and provides mechanisms for harvesting information from GitHub and ORCiD.
